\section{Conclusions and Future Work} 

In this paper, we have defined a problem common to two-sided
platforms, which is the allocation of visbility to platform
participants. We have also demonstrated the problem using data from an
actual online labor market. We described the relationship of this
problem to the classic economic assignment problem and proposed a
number of additional criteria for evaluating assignment mechanisms that
are relevant in the platform/repeated assignment setting that we are
focused on. We show that it is possible to create an assignment that
satisfied the exact proportion criterion, using our RC
algorithm, but also show that the standard solution is infeasible for
web-scale applications.  As a substitute, we proposed an algorithm RT
that has some nice properties that make it well-suited for
applications, including reasonable approximation to the equity
criterion. However, we hope that future work might demonstrate how
this algorithm could be modified, perhaps by having some ``memory'' of
past allocations to yield assignments that are equitable in
expectation.
