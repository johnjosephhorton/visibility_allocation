%%\ABSTRACT{
  We consider the problem two-sided platforms face in shaping the
  matches formed on the platform to reflect the platform's
  preferences. From this high-level motivation, we examine the problem
  in more concrete terms, using the main lever that platforms have for
  affecting matches---visibility of the trading parties to each
  other. We argue that the some of the standard ways of allocating
  visibility are likely to lead to allocations far away from what is
  efficient, given the platform creators preferences. We propose two
  mechanisms for shaping matches. The first is guaranteed to implement
  the platform's preferred, feasible allocation, but which is unlikely
  to be useful in practice due to its computational complexity. As an
  alternative, we propose a simple mechanism that reasonably
  approximates the first mechanism and is suitable for large scale
  application.
